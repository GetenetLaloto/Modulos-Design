# About this folder:

this folder contains configs for certain things of the page
- To search a partial do âŒ˜f or open search in your browser and type in 'partial-name: [name of partial]'

- you need to write all sass, css, coffee, and js files needed for the page, Order matters
- need to write partials in order that they would appear
  - some partials take file locations or data
