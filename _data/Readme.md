# About this folder:

this folder contains configs for certain things of the page
- To search a partial do âŒ˜f or open search in your browser and type in 'partial-name: [name of partial]'

- you need to write all local css/scss and js files needed for the page
- need to write partials in order that they would appear
  - some partials take file locations or data


## YML Struture/ and Partial imports
YML files should be name the page title (will change this in case title has space remind me if i don't)

  # all css to be imported by page. (all pages import bootstrap css in default layout)
  # some partial should have it's own sass to import make sure to import it to have it's style
  # or import any that overrides
  - "css/example.css"
  - "css/slideshow.css"
 js:
  # all javascript to be imported by page (all pages import jquery and bootstrap js in default layout)
