# About this folder:

this folder contains configs for certain things of the page
- To search a partial do âŒ˜f or open search in your browser and type in 'partial-name: [name of partial]'

- you need to write all local css/scss and js files needed for the page, Order matters
- need to write partials in order that they would appear
  - some partials take file locations or data


## YML Struture/ and Partial imports
YML files should be name the page title (will change this in case title has space remind me if i don't)
```YAML

  scss:
  # all css to be imported by page. (all pages import bootstrap css in default layout)
  # some partial should have it's own sass to import make sure to import it to have it's style
  # or import any that overrides
    - "css/main.css" # necessary ALWAYS
    - "css/navbar.css" # necessary if using default layout
    - "css/footer.css" # necessary if using default layout
    - "css/slideshow.css"
  coffee:
  # all coffee to be imported by page
  # some partial may have it's own js to import, make sure to import for functionality (this is used when joining the coffee together)
    - "main.coffee" # necessary if using default layout
    - "footer.coffee" # necessary if using default layout
    - "slideshow.coffee"
  js:
  # all javascript to be imported by page (all pages import jquery and bootstrap js in default layout)
